## Tech Stack

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)**: The primary templating engine used for rendering dynamic HTML content.
- **Node.js**: The backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.

## Why EJS?

EJS allows users to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It's a simple templating engine that lets you create dynamic content effortlessly. In this project, EJS is used to dynamically render the band names generated by the server.

## Directory Structure

- `public/styles`: Contains the CSS files for styling.
- `views`: Contains the EJS templates.
- `index.js`: The main server file.
- `package.json`: Lists all the project dependencies.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `node index.js` to start the server.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Enhancements
