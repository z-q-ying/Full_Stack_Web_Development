This is the 1st Boss Level Challenge Project for The Complete Web Development Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu. The website simulates a dice game challenge where on every refresh both dice are thrown and a random dice face is generated for both players. The player with larger Dice wins!

### [18.0 The Drum Kit Challenge](https://github.com/z-q-ying/full_stack_web_development/tree/e6bfdb910cb2f0e94c61e0a76cdebf4aad4aec76/18.0%20The%20Drum%20Kit%20Challenge) ###
This is another Boss Level project in Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp Course. The website allows you to create your own virtual drum kit using keypresses or button clicks. Utilizing concepts like the DOM, key events, and CSS animations, the project aims to teach how to add event listeners for interactive web experiences. By the end of this project, you'll not only understand how to make your website respond to user actions but also have an engaging website to showcase your newfound skills.
