This is the 1st Boss Level Challenge Project for The Complete Web Development Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu. The website simulates a dice game challenge where on every refresh both dice are thrown and a **random dice** face is generated for both players. The player with larger Dice wins!

This is a featured Boss Level project in Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp Course. The website enables users to **produce specific drum sounds through either keypresses or button clicks**. Built on foundational web development concepts such as the **DOM**, **key events**, and **CSS animations**, this project focuses on using event listeners to create a more interactive and engaging web experience.
